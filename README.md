## Agent with the following characterstics:

Core Components:
- Tool Definitions:
    - Basic math operations (multiply, add, subtract, divide, modulus)
    - Information retrieval tools:
        - wiki_search: Searches Wikipedia
        - web_search: Uses Tavily for web search
        - arvix_search: Searches Arxiv for research papers
- LLM Integration:
    - Supports multiple LLM providers:
        - Google Gemini
        - Groq (default, using qwen-qwq-32b model)
    - HuggingFace endpoints
Vector Store:
    - Uses Supabase with HuggingFace embeddings (sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2)
    - Enables semantic search over stored documents
Graph Architecture:
    - Built using StateGraph with MessagesState
Main nodes:
    - retriever: Finds similar questions from vector store
    - assistant: Processes user queries using LLM
    - tools: Handles tool execution
Workflow:
    - User query enters the graph
    - retriever node finds similar questions
    - assistant node processes the query with context
    - If tools are needed, routes to tools node
    - Returns final response
Key Features:
    - Modular design for easy tool addition
    - Support for multiple LLM providers
    - Integration with external services (Wikipedia, Arxiv, web search)
    - Vector-based retrieval for similar questions
Environment variable based configuration

## Additional files:

Files that are not required for the agent to work but have been provided as reference to customized the set of answers and test locally the agent.

### Data files
- gaia/metadata_gaia.jsonl : contains questions and answers from the Gaia dataset
- import_data.py : script to import data into the vector store
- test_database.py : script to test the vector store
- metadata.jsonl : contains questions and answers from the final assignment dataset

### Local agent implementation (alternative to Gradio)

- test_agent.py : script to test the agent locally

### How to push to huggingface space

To import data into the vector store, run the import_data.py script.
To test the vector store, run the test_database.py script.

**`<type>`**: The kind of change (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, etc.).
**`<scope>`** (optional): The part of the codebase affected (e.g., `auth`, `api`, `ui`).
**`<description>`**: A concise summary of changes (imperative tense: "add" instead of "added").
**Body** (optional): Detailed explanation if needed.
**Footer** (optional): References like `BREAKING CHANGE:` or issue links (`Closes #123`).
```
